🌱 Smart Irrigation System – An IoT Based Approach for Multi-Crop Farming

This project is an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System designed to optimize water usage in multi-crop farming. The system leverages sensor data and automation to monitor soil conditions, crop requirements, and environmental factors, enabling efficient irrigation management with minimal human intervention.

🔑 Features

IoT Integration – Real-time data collection from soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors.

Multi-Crop Support – Handles diverse crop requirements simultaneously with tailored irrigation strategies.

Automated Irrigation – Smart decision-making for when and how much to water crops.

Frontend Dashboard – Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for visualization of sensor data and system status.

Sustainability Focus – Reduces water wastage and improves crop yield efficiency.

🖥️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

IoT Hardware: Sensors (soil moisture, DHT11/22, etc.), Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32 (customizable based on hardware)

Communication: Wi-Fi / MQTT / HTTP (depending on setup)
